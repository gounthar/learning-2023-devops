## Linux Filesystem

In a Linux distribution, several critical directories hold essential system files, configurations, and user data. Among these, `/etc`, `/var`, `/bin`, `/usr`, and `/home` are some of the most important directories.

`/etc`: This directory contains system-wide configuration files. It houses crucial settings for various services, software applications, and the system itself. Files such as `/etc/passwd` (user account information), `/etc/apt/sources.list` (APT package manager configuration), and `/etc/hostname` (system hostname) reside here. Administrators often tweak settings in this directory to manage system behavior and software configurations.

`/var`: This directory stores variable data generated by running processes. It includes files that change frequently during system operation, such as logs (`/var/log`), databases (`/var/lib`), mail (`/var/mail`), and temporary files (`/var/tmp`). System logs and application data often reside here, offering insights into system health and performance.

`/bin` and `/usr`: These directories contain executable binaries and essential system commands. `/bin` holds fundamental commands crucial for system booting and repair, while `/usr/bin` contains standard user commands and binaries for installed software.

`/home`: This directory houses user home directories. Each user typically has a dedicated subdirectory (`/home/username`) storing their personal files, configurations, and settings. It's a critical space for user-specific data, allowing customization and privacy for individual users.

These directories form the backbone of a Linux system, encompassing critical configurations, system data, executable files, and user-specific information essential for the system's functionality and user experience.

## Permissions 

In Linux distributions, file permissions and ownership are managed through a robust system known as "rights management." This system controls access to files and directories, ensuring security and privacy across the system. Each file and directory has associated permissions determining who can read, write, or execute them. These permissions are categorized for three types of users: the file owner, the user group associated with the file, and others.

#### Read file permisions

When you use `ls -l` in a terminal, you'll see an output similar to this:

```bash
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 4096 Jan 1 12:00 example.txt
```

Let's break down what each part of this output signifies:

- **File Permissions:** The `-rwxr-xr--` part represents permissions for the file.
  - The first character indicates file type (`-` for a regular file).
  - The next nine characters (`rwxr-xr--`) denote permissions for owner, group, and others.
    - The first three characters represent owner permissions (`rwx`).
    - The next three represent group permissions (`r-x`).
    - The last three represent permissions for others (`r--`).

- **File Owner and Group:** The `user` is the file's owner, and `group` is the group associated with the file.

- **File Size, Date, and Name:** The `4096 Jan 1 12:00 example.txt` part shows the file size, modification date, and file name.

- `r` denotes read permission.
- `w` denotes write permission.
- `x` denotes execute permission.
- `-` denotes lack of a specific permission.

For instance, in `-rwxr-xr--`:
- The owner (`rwx`) has read, write, and execute permissions.
- The group (`r-x`) has read and execute permissions.
- Others (`r--`) have only read permission.

This visual representation from `ls -l` allows you to quickly interpret file permissions and understand who has access to read, write, and execute the file.

#### Changing Permissions

Permissions are modified using commands like `chmod`. For example, granting read and write permissions to the owner and group of a file named `example.txt`:

```bash
chmod ug+rw example.txt
```

#### Ownership Management

Ownership is altered using `chown`. To change the owner of `example.txt` to `newowner`:

```bash
chown newowner example.txt
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Changing permissions
chmod ug+rw example.txt

# Changing ownership
chown newowner example.txt
```

This script demonstrates using `chmod` and `chown` to modify file permissions and ownership, ensuring proper management and security within a Linux environment.

#### Octal notation

Octal notation simplifies permission settings using three digits, each representing permission types for owner, group, and others.

For instance:
- `chmod 755 file.txt` sets:
  - Owner: Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1) = 7
  - Group and Others: Read (4) + Execute (1) = 5

This notation streamlines permission management, facilitating precise access control in Linux.

## Navigation

#### `cd`

echo "HelloWorld !"
```
- Add the right of execution to the file 
```shell
chmod +x myscript.sh
```
- You can now execute the script
```bash
./myscript.sh
HelloWorld !
```

#### Passing argument to a bash shell script

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
nlines=$(wc -l < $1)
echo "There are $nlines lines in $1"
```

```shell
./count_lines.sh    /etc/group
There are 73 lines in /etc/group
```

## Processes & Services

#### `ps`

Display information about running processes.

**Example:**
```bash
ps aux
```

- `aux`: Display all processes with a user-oriented format.


When you run the `ps` command in Unix-like operating systems, it displays information about active processes. Among the various columns of information, you might see a column labeled `PD`. This column represents the "Parent Process ID" or "PPID".

The Parent Process ID refers to the Process ID (PID) of the parent process that spawned the current process. In other words, it indicates which process is the parent of the process listed in the current row.

For example, if you see a `pd` value of `1234`, it means that the process listed in that row was created by the process with PID `1234`.

Understanding the parent-child relationship between processes can be crucial for troubleshooting and analyzing system behavior. It helps in determining how processes are related and how they interact with each other.

Here's an example of the output of the `ps` command with the `pd` column:

```
  PID   PPID  CMD
  1001  999   bash
  1002  1001  └─── ls
  1003  1001  └─── ps
```

Process with PID `1001` (bash) is the parent process of processes with PIDs `1002` (ls) and `1003` (ps).
Processes `ls` and `ps` were spawned by the `bash` process.


#### `top` or `htop`
Monitoring tools to view system processes and resource usage.

**Example:**
```bash
top
```

- `Shift + M`: Sort by memory usage in `top`.
- `F6` (in `htop`): Sort by various fields.

#### Chrono table (Cron or CronTab)

Cron is a task scheduling utility for Unix and Unix-like systems. It allows users to schedule commands or scripts to run periodically at specified intervals.

To edit the cron configuration file:
```sh
crontab -e
```

```plaintext
* * * * * command_to_execute
```

The general syntax for configuring a task in a cron tab is as follows, where the five asterisks (*) represent respectively:
    - Minute (0-59)
    - Hour (0-23)
    - Day of the month (1-31)
    - Month (1-12)
    - Day of the week (0-7, 0 and 7 represent Sunday)

You can verify that the task has been added correctly using the `crontab -l` command.

#### SystemD

::: tip for MacOS
Use LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon service implementation [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html)
:::

Systemd is a service and process management system for Linux systems. It offers advanced features such as parallel startup, dependency management, service monitoring, and more.

Configuring a service with systemd involves creating a `.service` file that specifies the service's settings. Here's an example of a basic service file:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=Service Description

[Service]
Type=Service Type
ExecStart=/path/to/command_to_execute
Restart=Restart Policy

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

- `[Unit]`: Section containing metadata about the service.
- `[Service]`: Section describing the service itself.
- `[Install]`: Section specifying how the service should be installed.

To refresh the list of systemd services:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

To Start your service:

```shell
sudo systemctl start mon_service
```

To Check the status of your service:

```shell
sudo systemctl status mon_service
```

Console Output:
```shell
● mon_service.service - My demonstration service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/mon_service.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2024-02-14 10:00:00 CET; 5s ago
 Main PID: 12345 (mon_script.sh)
    Tasks: 1 (limit: 4915)
   Memory: 10.0M
   CGroup: /system.slice/mon_service.service
           └─12345 /path/to/mon_script.sh

Feb 14 10:00:00 hostname systemd[1]: Started My demonstration service.
```

You can also configure a Timer associated with your service:

1. Create a timer file named `mon_service.timer` in the directory `/etc/systemd/system/`:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mon_service.timer
```

2. Add the following content to the file:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=My timer for mon_service

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00
Unit=mon_service.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

In this example, `OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00` means the timer will trigger every day at midnight.

To start your timer: 
```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mon_service.timer
sudo systemctl start mon_service.timer
```

To check the status of your timer:

```shell
sudo systemctl status mon_service.timer
```

## Network Debugging

#### `ping`

Test connectivity to a remote host.

**Example:**
```bash
ping google.com
```

#### `ssh`

Securely connect to a remote server.

**Example:**

```


####  `netstat` 

The `netstat` command is a network utility tool used to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics. It provides information about network connections and routing tables, which can be useful for troubleshooting network-related issues.

Display all TCP and UDP connections:
```sh
netstat -a
```

Display TCP connections with numerical addresses:
```sh
netstat -t -n
```

Display routing table:
```sh
netstat -r
```

Display listening TCP sockets:
```sh
netstat -l -t
```

#### `wget`

Retrieve content from web servers via HTTP, HTTPS, FTP.

**Example:**
```bash
wget https://example.com/file.tar.gz
```

#### `ip`

The `ip` command is used for showing/manipulating routing, network devices, interfaces, and tunnels in Unix-like operating systems.

To display network interfaces and their addresses, use the following command:

```bash
ip address show
```

Output:

```

### 🧪 Exercise 1-Bis - File System Management

1. It seems that "linuxman" is not a superhero. In fact, he is called "Tux" and should be located in the "mascots" directory. Using the "mv" command, move the file "linuxman" to "tux" in the mascots directory.
2. Rename the directory "superheroes" to "comics".
3. Using the "echo" command: write into the file "batman" the content "Bruce Wayne hides behind this character".
4. Using the "echo" command: append to the file "batman" the content "he lives in Gotham".
5. Using the "echo" command: write into the file "daredevil" the content "Homer Simpson hides behind this character".
6. Oh no, it's not Homer. With the "echo" command, overwrite the content of the file "daredevil" with the content "daredevil is a blind comic character".
7. Using the "cat" command, in a single command, copy the contents of the "batman" and "daredevil" files into the "mascots/mixdarbat" file.
8. Switch to root mode.
9. Create a user named "fanboy".
10. Copy the directory "characters" into /home/fanboy.
11. Use the "chown" command to change the owner and group of this directory.
12. Create a symbolic link "persofanboy" pointing to /home/fanboy/characters.
13. Create a symbolic link "perso_yourname" pointing to /home/yourname/characters.
14. Using the "ls" command, save the complete tree structure of /home/fanboy/characters into a file "14.txt".
15. In the file "14.txt", you will find lines with the word "total". Using the grep command, copy the contents of the file "14.txt" into the file "15.txt" by removing occurrences of the word "total".
16. Save the last 250 lines of your history in the file "myhistory" by removing any lines where you used the "cd" command. You will use the grep command again.

Don't you forget to add the right permissions to the script file...

### 🧪  Exercise 2-Bis - Cron on GitPod

Unfortunately, Gitpod does not support `cron` jobs because it's a cloud-based development environment and each workspace is ephemeral.
This means that the workspace does not maintain state between sessions, so any `cron` jobs you set up would be lost when the workspace is stopped.
However, you can install `cron` in your Gitpod workspace using` apt-get.`
Please note that even though you can install and start the cron daemon, it will not persist after the workspace is stopped.
Here's how you can install and start cron:
    
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cron
sudo service cron start
```
After running these commands, you can verify that cron is running by using the following command:
```bash
sudo service cron status
```
You can then create a cron job by creating a script that will add an entry to the crontab:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the crontab entry
CRON_ENTRY="*/5 * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/your/script.sh /root/folder/\$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d)"

# Add the entry to crontab
(crontab -l; echo "$CRON_ENTRY" ) | crontab -
```

Of course, you will have to modify the script so `/path/to/your/script.sh` points to your earlier `bash` script that creates the root folder "personnages" at your user home.
The whole script could then look like:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script sets up a cron job that runs a specific script every 5 minutes.
# The script that is run is `personnages.sh`, located in the current working directory.
# The cron job passes a timestamped directory name as an argument to `personnages.sh`.

# Update the package lists for upgrades and new package installations
sudo apt-get update

# Install the cron package
sudo apt-get install cron

# Start the cron service
sudo service cron start

# Check the status of the cron service
sudo service cron status

# Define the script path
# This is the path to the script that the cron job will run.
# It's set to `personnages.sh` in the current working directory.
SCRIPT_PATH="$(pwd)/personnages.sh"

# Define the date format
# This is the format of the timestamp that will be appended to the directory name.
# It includes the year, month, day, hour, and minute.
DATE_FORMAT="\$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H-\%M)"

# Define the crontab entry
# This is the cron job that will be added to the crontab.
# It runs the `personnages.sh` script every 5 minutes, passing a timestamped directory name as an argument.
CRON_ENTRY="*/5 * * * * /bin/bash $SCRIPT_PATH $HOME/personnages-$DATE_FORMAT"

# Add the entry to crontab
# This command adds the defined cron job to the crontab.
# It first lists the existing crontab entries, then appends the new entry, and finally installs the new crontab.
(crontab -l; echo "$CRON_ENTRY" ) | crontab -

```

### 🧪  Exercise 2-Ter - Make Cron available on GitPod from the start

To make `cron` available on GitPod from the start, you need to customize the Docker image used by GitPod.
I know, we have not talked about Docker yet, but it is a containerization platform that allows you to create custom images with the tools and dependencies you need.
This can be done by creating a `.gitpod.Dockerfile` in your repository with the necessary commands to install cron.
Here is an example of what your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` could look like:

```Dockerfile
# This Dockerfile is used to create a custom Gitpod workspace image.
# Gitpod is a service that provides ready-to-code development environments in the cloud.

# The base image is gitpod/workspace-python, which includes a python development environment.
FROM gitpod/workspace-python

# Switch to the root user to have the necessary permissions for the following operations.
USER root

# Install cron and tree packages.
# Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.
# Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented listing of files.
# The apt-get update command is used to download package information from all configured sources.
# The apt-get install command is used to install the specified packages.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cron tree

# Start the cron service.
# The service command is used to run a System V init script.
RUN service cron start

```

This `Dockerfile` starts from the `gitpod/workspace-full` image, which is a standard image provided by GitPod that includes a full development environment.
It then switches to the `root` user to install `cron` and start the `cron` service.
Next, you need to reference this `Dockerfile` in your `.gitpod.yml` configuration file. 
Here is an example of what your `.gitpod.yml` could look like:

```yaml
# This is the .gitpod.yml configuration file for Gitpod.
# Gitpod is a service that provides ready-to-code development environments in the cloud.

# The 'image' field specifies the Docker image to use for the workspace.
# The 'file' field under 'image' points to the Dockerfile that defines the Docker image.
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

# The 'tasks' field is a list of tasks to run when the workspace starts.
# Each task can have 'init' and 'command' fields.
# The 'init' field is a command that is run when the workspace is first initialized.
# The 'command' field is a command that is run after the 'init' command.
tasks:
  # This task makes all .sh files in any subdirectory of the current directory executable.
  - init: chmod +x ./*/*.sh

```
