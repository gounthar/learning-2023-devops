### What is DevOps ?

### Definition

![loop](../assets/images/devops_loop.png)

 It's **cultural** and **professional movement** that stresses **communication**, **collaboration**, integration, and 
 **automation** to improve the flow of work between **software developers (Dev)**  and **IT operations professionals (Ops)** while 
 automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
It aims at establishing culture and environment where **building, testing and releasing softwares, can happen rapidly**, frequently and more reliably.‚Äù

DevOps is...
* Continuous delivery
* Monitoring
* a person who can perform both Dev and Ops roles
* a team of developers and operation staff
* a movement, a philosophy, a way of thinking
* a culture movement
* means cross skilling people

DevOps is not...
* A Developers managing Production
* All About Automation
* Equals to "Agile‚Äú
* a Process, a Methodology, a Framework, a Tool

### Why devOps ?

Here are 4 trends that impulse devOps mouvement.

#### Cloud emergence
![loop](../assets/images/trend1.png)

The `cloud` refers to a network of remote servers accessed over the internet to store, manage, and process data, providing on-demand computing resources and services without requiring direct local server infrastructure.

#### From monolith to distributed services
![loop](../assets/images/trend2.png)

A `monolithic application` is a software architecture where all components and functionalities are integrated and interconnected into a single, indivisible unit, typically running as a single process.

ex : A typical example of a Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) application could be an online banking system that uses JEE technologies like Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and Java Persistence API (JPA) to handle user authentication, transaction processing, account management, and database interactions within a scalable and secure environment.

a `Distributed architecture` refers to a system design where multiple components or services are deployed across different computers or networks, working together to achieve a common goal. These components communicate and coordinate with each other through networks, enabling scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization across various locations.

#### Multi / Micro services architecture
![loop](../assets/images/trend3.png)

A `multi-services app` typically refers to a software application that integrates or provides access to multiple distinct functionalities, features, or services within a single platform or interface, allowing users to access various services or capabilities without needing separate applications for each function. These apps often offer a range of services like messaging, payments, social networking, and more, catering to diverse user needs within a unified environment.

A `microservices app` is a software architecture that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services, each focused on specific business capabilities and communicating through well-defined APIs. These services are typically small, scalable, and can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, allowing for flexibility, agility, and easier management of complex systems.

![ms](../assets/images/ms.png)

#### Continuous delivery / integration
![loop](../assets/images/trend4.png)

`Continuous Delivery (CD)` is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository. Each integration triggers automated build and test processes to detect errors early.

`Continuous Integration (CI)` Integration in the context of CI/CD involves aligning and merging development efforts from various stages (such as development, staging, and production) to ensure that code changes seamlessly transition through these environments, maintaining consistency and reliability.


It starting up a tug of war between developpers and Ops :

| Developers     | IT Operations  |
|----------------|----------------|
| Freedom to create and deploy apps fast           | Quickly and fexibly respond to changing needs     |
| Define and package application needs        | Standardize, secure, and manage     |

### A bit of History

The historical roots of cloud computing, traced its emergence back to the 1950s with the inception of mainframe computing and the subsequent development of ARPANET, a precursor to the internet.

Pivotal moments in cloud evolution, include the rise of virtualization in the 1990s, which transformed server utilization, and the introduction of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the mid-2000s, revolutionizing access to cloud services. It permit to enable key models such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that have shaped the cloud landscape and also pay as you go business model

Another main evolution enabled devops pratices is the evolution of computer containers, starting from their inception. The historical timeline, begin with early Unix days, emphasizing the importance of process isolation to maximize computing resources.

Important milestones such as chroot in 1979, which enabled application isolation, and subsequent advancements like FreeBSD Jails, OpenVZ, Linux-VServer, and the integration of namespaces and cgroups into the Linux kernel will be discussed.  Tools like Warden, Borg at Google, Solaris Containers, and Cloud Foundry, leverage new concepts for application isolation.

Lastly, the groundbreaking introduction of usernamespace into the Linux kernel in 2013, marked the inception of Docker. This influential tool simplifies container creation and management based on Linux kernel functionalities. Through these advancements, a new era in application deployment was ushered in, transforming the landscape of computing.


### Software stack architecture

![architecture](../assets/images/architecture.png)

#### Layers of a Software Stack:

`Application Layer`: User-facing applications like web browsers, business software.

`Data Layer`: Manages and stores data: databases, data lakes, file storage systems.

`Runtime Layer`: Environment for executing software: Java Runtime Environment, .NET Framework.

`Middleware Laye`r`: Intermediary layer: web servers, application servers, message brokers, APIs.

`Operating System Laye`r: Manages hardware resources: Windows, Linux, macOS.

`Virtualization Layer`: Abstracts hardware: virtual machines (VMs), containers.

`Servers Layer`: Provides computational resources: application servers, database servers.

`Storage Layer`: Manages data storage: block storage, object storage, databases.

`Networking Layer`: Handles communication: LANs, WANs, routers, switches, TCP/IP.

#### Service models

**On-Premises:** This refers to the traditional method of hosting and managing computing resources within an organization's physical location or data center. With on-premises infrastructure, all hardware, software, servers, networking equipment, and data storage are maintained and managed by the organization's IT staff.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers scalable and on-demand resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users can rent these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing for flexibility and cost-efficiency without having to manage the physical hardware.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS):** PaaS is a cloud computing service that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. It typically includes tools for building, testing, and deploying applications. PaaS offers a framework that simplifies the development process, enabling developers to focus on coding rather than managing hardware or software updates.

**Software as a Service (SaaS):** SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. It allows users to access and use software hosted in the cloud without needing to install or maintain it on their devices. Examples of SaaS include email services, customer relationship management (CRM) tools, and productivity software like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365.

These models represent different layers of cloud services, providing varying levels of abstraction from infrastructure to applications, catering to different needs and preferences of businesses and users.
